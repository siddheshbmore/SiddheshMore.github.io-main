								<p>Watching a YouTube video titled ‘Why Machine Learning is the future’ by Sundar Pichai gave me a feeling of consciousness, back in February 2017. He states that better computational power and access to a lot of relevant data are the two main causes of the progress in ML. Working with data - whether it is data mining, data analysis or data visualization and emphasizing it with ML algorithms or data storage has always made me feel exhilarating. My immediate goal after masters is to become a Data Scientist. In the long run I envision myself becoming a Chief Data Scientist as I am hugely inspired by D J Patil, Former Chief Data Scientist at the White House, first ever chief data scientist appointed by US government. His markers about striving for curiosity, team building, social and local problem solving always inspire me to crave for becoming a CDS. Apart from academics, I have been a part of many activities during my under graduation. Having participated in cultural activities and having managed various events has not only improved my decision making but has also made me composed and tolerant. The leadership quality during my tenure as a Head-Boy in my school and Student Council Head of my institute in my under graduation has also strengthened me with respect to the decision making power. I am a motivated and a versatile engineer with demonstrated experience in Data Science domain. Experienced in data extraction, visualization, manipulation, developing ML algorithms and developing final predictive model. I believe that I am a strong problem solver, technical writer and have excellent communication skills. I am dedicated to exceeding goals and expectations.</p>
